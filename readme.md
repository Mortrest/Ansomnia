# Ansomnia: Detecting Anomalies in Sleep Patterns

Ansomnia is a project that I have created to detect events, mainly anomalies, in the sleep patterns of an individual. The data for this project is gathered from a wearable watch of the individual, and the model has been trained on the data of eight months of that person. The project aims to identify patterns that are indicative of sleep disturbances or disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea.

The model analyzes various features of sleep, including duration, quality, and stages, to detect any abnormalities. These features are extracted from the raw data collected from the wearable watch, which includes information such as heart rate, movement, and breathing patterns during sleep.

Ansomnia has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. By detecting anomalies in sleep patterns, it can alert individuals and their healthcare providers to potential issues early on, allowing for earlier intervention and treatment.

The project is still in its early stages, and there is much work to be done to refine the model and improve its accuracy. However, I am excited about the potential of Ansomnia to make a positive impact on people's health and well-being.
