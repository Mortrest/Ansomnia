# Ansomnia: Detecting Anomalies in Sleep Patterns

Ansomnia is a project that I have created to detect events, mainly anomalies, in the sleep patterns of an individual. The data for this project is gathered from a wearable watch of the individual, and the model has been trained on the data of eight months of that person. The project aims to identify patterns that are indicative of sleep disturbances or disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea.

The model analyzes various features of sleep, including duration, quality, and stages, to detect any abnormalities. These features are extracted from the raw data collected from the wearable watch, which includes information such as heart rate, movement, and breathing patterns during sleep.

## Model

In this particular project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify and detect anomalies using three different methods: Isolation Forest, Gaussian Mixture, and K-Means. Each of these methods served as a potential solution for anomaly detection within the dataset.

Upon evaluating the results of these methods, it was revealed that Isolation Forest outperformed both Gaussian Mixture and K-Means in terms of its effectiveness in anomaly detection. This finding highlights the superiority of Isolation Forest as a valuable tool in identifying and isolating anomalous data points.

The overarching objective of this project revolves around the exploration of anomalies and seasonalities within steps and sleep data. By examining these two variables in tandem, the aim is to uncover any potential correlations that may exist between them. Consequently, this analysis enables a deeper understanding of the relationship between steps and sleep, shedding light on any unusual patterns or trends that may emerge.  

## Implications

Ansomnia has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. By detecting anomalies in sleep patterns, it can alert individuals and their healthcare providers to potential issues early on, allowing for earlier intervention and treatment.

The project is still in its early stages, and there is much work to be done to refine the model and improve its accuracy. However, I am excited about the potential of Ansomnia to make a positive impact on people's health and well-being.
